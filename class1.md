# 1. Introduction to Databases

### Definition of DBMS and its Components
- **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software system that uses a standard method of cataloging, retrieving, and running queries on data.
- **Components of DBMS**:
  - **Hardware**: Physical devices used for storage.
  - **Software**: DBMS software, including the operating system.
  - **Data**: The actual data stored in the database.
  - **Procedures**: Instructions and rules to use the database.
  - **Database Access Language**: Language used to interact with the database (e.g., SQL).
  - **Users**: Database administrators, developers, end-users.

### File Systems vs. DBMS
- **File System**:
  - Data is stored in separate files.
  - Data redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Difficult data access and isolation.
  - No support for data integrity or security.

- **DBMS**:
  - Centralized system for managing data.
  - Reduced data redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Easier data access, management, and sharing.
  - Data integrity, security, and transaction management.

### Advantages of DBMS
- **Data Redundancy Control**: Minimizes duplication of data.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
- **Data Security**: Implements access control measures.
- **Data Sharing**: Supports multi-user environments.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automates data backup and restoration processes.

### Types of Databases
- **Hierarchical Databases**: Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
- **Network Databases**: More complex relationships between entities; data is represented as a graph.
- **Relational Databases**: Uses tables (relations) to store data; supports SQL queries.
- **Object-Oriented Databases**: Data is stored as objects, similar to OOP concepts.

### Overview of Database Applications
- **Business Systems**: Sales, Inventory, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
- **Banking**: Transactions, Accounts Management, and ATM operations.
- **Education**: Student Information Systems, Learning Management Systems.
- **Healthcare**: Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Patient Management.
- **E-commerce**: Order processing, Customer Data, and Recommendations.

# Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs DBMS

| Feature                | **Data Warehouse**                           | **Data Lake**                                      | **DBMS (Database Management System)**               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Centralized storage for structured, historical data used for reporting and analysis. | Stores raw data in its native format, often used for big data and analytics. | Manages current transactional data in a structured format. |
| **Data Type**           | Structured data (e.g., tables, relational databases). | Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., logs, images, videos, JSON, CSV). | Mostly structured data (tables with rows and columns). |
| **Data Processing**     | Schema-on-write (data is structured before being written). | Schema-on-read (data is structured when accessed or read). | Schema-on-write (data structure defined at creation). |
| **Use Case**            | Business intelligence (BI), reporting, and complex queries for historical data. | Big data, machine learning, data exploration, and real-time data analysis. | Transactional processing, daily operations, CRUD operations. |
| **Performance**         | Optimized for complex queries and analytics, fast query performance on structured data. | Not optimized for queries; more suited for large-scale data storage and exploration. | Optimized for real-time transaction processing, quick updates and retrieval. |
| **Data Governance**     | High level of data governance and quality control (ETL pipelines ensure data consistency). | Less governance in place initially; data can be ingested in raw form and processed later. | High data governance for transactions (ACID properties ensure consistency). |
| **Storage**             | Typically expensive due to optimization for query performance and structured data storage. | Cost-effective storage for massive volumes of data; cheaper for unstructured data. | Varies depending on the DBMS used; optimized for structured data storage. |
| **Scalability**         | Scales for large volumes of structured data but may struggle with unstructured or semi-structured data. | Highly scalable, handles large volumes of raw data (petabytes or more). | Scalable but mainly designed for managing structured data. |
| **Data Access**         | Data is accessed through SQL queries or specialized BI tools. | Data is accessed using various big data tools and languages (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Python). | Data is accessed using SQL queries, APIs, or database languages like PL/SQL. |
| **Examples**            | Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, Google BigQuery. | Hadoop, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage. | Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL. |
| **Processing Tools**    | ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools like Informatica, Talend. | ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) tools like Spark, Databricks. | ETL tools or in-built query processors for CRUD operations. |
| **Time to Insight**     | Data is prepared and processed for reporting; slower for exploratory analysis. | Faster for exploratory analysis (raw data), but slower for structured queries. | Quick for real-time operational data access and updates. |
| **Integration**         | Integrated with BI tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for analytics and reporting. | Integrated with big data tools (e.g., Spark, Kafka) for data processing and machine learning. | Integrated with various applications and platforms for operational tasks. |

### Summary
- **Data Warehouse**: Best suited for structured data, analytics, and reporting. Used when you need reliable and processed data for decision-making.
- **Data Lake**: Ideal for storing a variety of data formats (structured, unstructured) at scale. Best for data scientists and engineers who need to analyze or transform raw data.
- **DBMS**: Designed for managing transactional, operational data in structured formats. Suitable for everyday business operations where quick access to real-time data is required.
