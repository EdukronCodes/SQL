# 1. Introduction to Databases

### Definition of DBMS and its Components
- **Database Management System (DBMS)** is a software system that uses a standard method of cataloging, retrieving, and running queries on data.
- **Components of DBMS**:
  - **Hardware**: Physical devices used for storage.
  - **Software**: DBMS software, including the operating system.
  - **Data**: The actual data stored in the database.
  - **Procedures**: Instructions and rules to use the database.
  - **Database Access Language**: Language used to interact with the database (e.g., SQL).
  - **Users**: Database administrators, developers, end-users.

### File Systems vs. DBMS
- **File System**:
  - Data is stored in separate files.
  - Data redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Difficult data access and isolation.
  - No support for data integrity or security.

- **DBMS**:
  - Centralized system for managing data.
  - Reduced data redundancy and inconsistency.
  - Easier data access, management, and sharing.
  - Data integrity, security, and transaction management.

### Advantages of DBMS
- **Data Redundancy Control**: Minimizes duplication of data.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
- **Data Security**: Implements access control measures.
- **Data Sharing**: Supports multi-user environments.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automates data backup and restoration processes.

### Types of Databases
- **Hierarchical Databases**: Data is organized in a tree-like structure.
- **Network Databases**: More complex relationships between entities; data is represented as a graph.
- **Relational Databases**: Uses tables (relations) to store data; supports SQL queries.
- **Object-Oriented Databases**: Data is stored as objects, similar to OOP concepts.

### Overview of Database Applications
- **Business Systems**: Sales, Inventory, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
- **Banking**: Transactions, Accounts Management, and ATM operations.
- **Education**: Student Information Systems, Learning Management Systems.
- **Healthcare**: Electronic Medical Records (EMR), Patient Management.
- **E-commerce**: Order processing, Customer Data, and Recommendations.
