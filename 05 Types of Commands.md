# Types of SQL Commands

## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
These commands are used to define or modify the structure of the database, such as creating, altering, or deleting tables and other database objects.

- **CREATE**: Used to create a new database object (e.g., table, view).
- **ALTER**: Used to modify an existing database object (e.g., add/remove columns).
- **DROP**: Used to delete an existing database object.
- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all records from a table, but keeps the table structure for future use.

## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
These commands are used to manipulate data stored in the database.

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from the database.
- **INSERT**: Inserts new data into a table.
- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data within a table.
- **DELETE**: Removes data from a table.

## 3. Data Control Language (DCL)
These commands are used to manage permissions and control access to the database.

- **GRANT**: Gives user access privileges to the database.
- **REVOKE**: Withdraws user access privileges.

## 4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
These commands are used to manage transactions in the database.

- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the current transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes made in the current transaction.
- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can roll back later.

## 5. Data Query Language (DQL)
This is focused on retrieving data from the database.

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data based on conditions (this command also falls under DML but is categorized separately because it is specifically for querying).
